# DATAPROBLEM PART 1 & 2
The code I wrote for the part one question can run on any IDE but should have the same name as my CSV file.

From the Data given in the CSV file, the inference that I came up with was that,
there were a lot of data given and at some point in graph visualization 
it can be seen that there is a decline and an increase at each point which doesn't show the progress we want to see.
I wrote a code to visualize just 100 patients and check their progress and I couldn't draw any conclusion from that graph. 
I have attached a screenshot of how it looked like.
In the graph visualization the data provided changes on several points.
The assumption I can draw from the data is dividing them into smaller sets for 
proper visualization. 
With just the ones provided, it is a lot to visualize.

The 3 additional pieces of information I will include to prevent any collisions
but clearer visualiztion and can contribute to anxiety disorder is:
1. Age of patients  
2. Gender of patients
3. Location of patients 

In all the proper way to visualize the data provided is to divide it into chunks like I did in my
visualization. I pulled out 100 random patients and I plotted a graph for each patient to visualize their progress.
Now, I did this because, each patient is unique from the other and due to this they must have seperate graphs to visualize their progress.
I have added a screenshot of this visualization 


Since this will be on a larger scale in the Medical field, this approach is likely to prevent:
i) Data Misuse 
ii) Time wasting 
and lastly 
iii) Help improve clearer visualization.




PART 2 OF THIS PROJECT 
The question 1 is titled as SQL_PROJECT and can be run using Microsoft SQL
I have attached a word documents that has the answers to questions 2-4 of the part 2.
