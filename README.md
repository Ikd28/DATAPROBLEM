# DATAPROBLEM PART 1 
From the Data given in the CSV file, the inference that I came up with was that,
there was a lot of data given and at some point in graph visualization 
it can be seen that there is a decline and an increase at each point.
In the graph visualization the data provided changes on several points.
The assumption I can draw from the data is dividing them into smaller sets for 
proper visualization. 
With just the ones provided, it is a lot to visualize.

The 3 additional pieces of information I will include to prevent any collisions
but clearer visualiztion and can contribute to anxiety disorder is:
1. Age of patients  
2.Gender of patients
3. Location of patients 

In all the proper way to visualize the data provided is to divide it into chunks like I did in my
visualization. I pulled out 100 random patients and I plotted a graph to represent it.

Since this will be on a larger scale in the Medical field, this approach is likely to prevent:
i) Data Misuse 
ii) Time wasting 
and lastly 
iii) Help improve clearer visualization.




PART 2 OF THIS PROJECT 
The question 1 is titled as SQL_PROJECT and can be run using Microsoft SQL
I have attached a word documents that has the answers to questions 2-4 of the part 2.
